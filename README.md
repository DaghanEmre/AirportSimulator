# AirportSimulator
Designing and implementing a JAVA program that generates queues according to the commands read from an input file.

Your application will simulate an airport landing and takeoff system. This airport will have three runways, runway 0,
runway 1 and runway 2. Each runway can handle one takeoff or landing at each time slot. runway 0 and runway
1 are used only for landing. runway 2 is used only for takeoff except emergency landings (when plane runs out of
fuel). There are 3 queues, two queues for landing (one for runaway 0, one for runaway 1) and the other for takeoff.
Arriving plane, if it has enough fuel, will be ready for takeoff.
